# ChatPod

ChatPod is a Chrome Web Extension that adds a new chat experience to any website. Here at ChatPod, we aim to make you “eat your words”. 

ChatPod allows users to open live chat rooms and communicate with others that are on the same web page. For example, multiple people can discuss the truthfulness of a Wikipedia article with ChatPod installed. Viewers can exchange opinions with each other while watching Netflix. The possibilities are endless.
